        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Joschi! Just a normal guy from Germany. A few years ago I decided to give Social Media a try and my Instagram actually got pretty big.
          I sold my page but what stayed is the name "Ninja". Now I want to focus on other things and get away from Social Media. That's why I created this page.
          It's just a simple website about my projects!
