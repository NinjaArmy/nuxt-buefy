        <p>I want to create apps that can help a lot of people. Since I really like E-Commerce I probably start with some simple Shopware 6 Apps or Plugins!
        I also know some other technologies and could imagine to create other Apps as well. For now I just have the most fun with Shopware so that's what I will focus on in the next months or even years..
        </p>

        <p>I already worked with some technologies including</p>

          <li>Java</li>
